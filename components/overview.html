    <p>With the creation of the Electrical Engineering program, UC Merced has focused on providing students with the technical skills required using a traditional curriculum. However, the field of electrical engineering is constantly evolving with the growth of the digital age. As technology advances and new problems present themselves, electrical engineers who can meet the needs of the modern world are in high demand, and adapting electrical engineering education has become increasingly important.</p>

    <p>A new initiative aims to do just that. Backed by the National Science Foundation's Revolutionizing Engineering Departments program (1), UC Merced is adapting and applying proven redesign approaches developed at other institutions. This project aims to expand UC Merced's EE program by introducing new approaches that strengthen the connection between coursework, engineering practice, and the communities our students come from. The effort emphasizes hands-on learning and collaborative course design.</p>

    <p>As a part of this effort, the research team is forming a team of staff, educational experts, and even previous students to redesign classes that will bring stronger understanding across these courses. By rethinking how these courses are taught, the program is seeking to build a more cohesive and effective learning pathway.</p>

    <p>Another key consideration is ensuring that the path to becoming an engineer feels meaningful. Most UC Merced students are from California, with many coming from the Central Valley. Incorporating course content that addresses real challenges facing the region can help students feel more connected to their studies and more invested in their work. To support this, the project seeks to reframe the Electrical Engineering curriculum around Central Valley and other real-world contexts and focus on issues that directly impact the communities' students call home.</p>

    <p>To ensure this project leads to real change, the research team is not only collaborating with UC Merced's Electrical Engineering faculty but also with University of San Diego and Iowa State University, two institutions whose earlier RED initiatives offer evidence-based approaches we are translating to UC Merced's context. The team will begin by focusing on two key courses, with the long-term goal of cultivating a broader cultural shift that transforms the department as a whole. By prioritizing design thinking, grounding coursework in Central Valley challenges, and better preparing students for the challenges of the engineering profession, UC Merced is leading the way in engineering education.</p>

      <h3>What We're Building</h3>
      <p>A culture in the EE program where change is welcomed, courses evolve with student needs, and faculty-student partnerships continually improve learning to better support every engineer.</p>
