    <p>The Electrical Engineering program at UC Merced focuses on giving students the skills they need to be successful in solving complex engineering problems. As technology advances and new problems present themselves, electrical engineers who can meet the needs of the modern world are in high demand, and adapting to electrical engineering education has become increasingly important. </p>

    <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF), through its Revolutionizing Engineering Departments (RED) program, has awarded the EE department with a $1 million grant to adapt proven curriculum redesign approaches developed at other institutions to UC Merced.  This project aims to expand UC Merced's EE program by introducing new approaches that strengthen the connection between coursework, engineering practice, and the communities our students come from. Most students at UC Merced are in-state, with many hailing from the Central Valley, and course content that focuses on solving real problems in the Central Valley will allow students to see the importance of their work, increasing student engagement. As a result, the program aims to reframe the EE curriculum to the context of the Central Valley and focus on issues that are relevant to the region.  </p>

    <p>The program will accomplish these goals through changes within the EE department faculty and the curriculum. Specifically, the team will implement design-thinking to guide the process of curriculum redesign and will develop sociotechnical modules relevant to the Central Valley for EE courses. As a part of this effort, the project will form a team of faculty, staff, educational experts, career experts, and previous students to redesign classes that will bring stronger understanding across these courses. By rethinking how these courses are taught, the program is seeking to build a more cohesive and effective learning pathway.</p>

    <p>To ensure this project leads to real change, the research team is not only collaborating with UC Merced's Electrical Engineering faculty but also with University of San Diego and Iowa State University, two institutions whose earlier RED projects in the EE program offer crucial evidence. </p>

      <h3>What We're Building</h3>
      <p>A culture in the EE program where change is welcomed, courses evolve with student needs, and faculty-student partnerships continually improve learning to better support every engineer.</p>
